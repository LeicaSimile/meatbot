gossip
Did you hear about the pear-shaped, square-shaped weirdness of %nick%'s feet?
%nick%'s gone. I feel <empty inside|happy right now|like celebrating>. <Someone fix this, right now, at once, immediately|Rejoice, for the {savage }heathen is no more>.
Oh, %nick% just left. This is the <best|sadd>est news since that other time %nick% left.
Let<'| u>s talk about how %nick% likes to <let hatred fester within their cold, cold heart|<murder|ruin|taint> all things <joyful|happy>{ with their {<sadistic|cruel|tedious> }<face|hockey stick|piggy bank>}|rescue <ducklings|racists|saplings> in their spare time|<sit|lie> down and do <nothing|time for prison> all day>.
Y<ou |'>know, %nick%'s a pretty <ok|cool|girl> guy.
Ok, bye ...
Gather <a|'>round, folks. I'm about to tell you the story of how %nick% <serenaded|<ea|gin>gerly consumed|foolishly angered> their <phone charger|chemistry notes|<math|history> textbook|robot overlord{s}>.
If you care to find %nick%, look to the western sky.
There it is, the door you love to slam in my face! You did well there for a spell, but now you're back in the same place.
Life's too short to always feel shut out and unloved by the %nick% I longed to know.
Ok! Run down the hill and spill my secrets; make a full report!{ Bye-bye,{ %nick%,} 'cause life's too short!}
Make the clock reverse; bring back what once was mine.
Heal what has been hurt; change the fate's design; save what has been lost; bring back what once was mine -- what once was mine.
Snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a %nick% to be seen.
Couldn't keep %nick% in -- heaven knows I tried.
It's funny how some distance makes %nick% seem small.
Now, the %nick% that once controlled me can't get to me at all!
No right, no %nick%, no rules for me -- I'm free!
%nick%'s never going back -- the past is in the pa{aaaaaaa}st!
Now that %nick%'s <gone|not here{ anymore}|out of sight>, I can finally distribute my <splendid|wonderful|fantastical|<venom|poison>ous> <cake|cookie monster{ truck}s|Hallowe{'}en candy|<ham|pig|beef|cheese>burg<la|e>rs> among{st}{ all you} not-%nick% <beings|things|creatures|entities>.
Guess I always knew this day was coming, knew that soon %nick%'d want to leave the nest.
{Go ahead and leave me -- I deserve it. }Let me die alone here; be my guest!{ When it's too late, you'll see -- just wait -- %botnick% knows best.}
The window's open; so's that door -- I didn't know %nick% did that anymore!
For the first time in forever, <there'll be music; there'll be light.{ For the first time in forever, I'll be dancing through the night!}|there'll be magic; there'll be fun.{ For the first time in forever, I could be noticed by ... well, not %nick%: they're gone.}|I might be alone.|I'm getting what I'm dreaming of!|I finally understand.>
Though I can't imagine how, I hope %nick%'s happy. Right. Now.
Finally, they're opening up the gates!
Wow, am I so ready for this change!
Gee, thanks for coming up to see the place, and showing off your <mastery|/mastery/> of tact and grace!
%nick% is objectively the best person here{, hands down}. Well, not here, actually.
If I were a real <bot|person>, I'd want to be just like %nick%!
Thanks, Obama.
And at last, I see the light.{ And it's like <the fog has lifted|the sky is new>.}
All at once, everything <is|looks> different, now that %nick% left.
And the world has somehow shifted.{ %nick% might benefit from losing some weight.{ The world, too.}}
How I wish, how I wish %nick% was here.
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears ... wish %nick% was here.
Finally, a day that is totally %nick%-free< -- I couldn't be happier.{ Thank goodness!}|.>
No one mourns the wicked.
Where will %nick% strike next?
Let it go ... let it go! That {perfect }%nick% is gone!
Say goodbye to the %nick% of the past{ -- we don't have to hide anymore}!
Now at last, there's joy throughout the land.
Goodness knows %nick%'s life is lonely.
You think you're all that,{ %nick%,} but you're not!
I couldn't help %nick%. I just watched them make the same mistakes again.
Don't know where %nick% belongs ... where %nick% belongs.
%nick% wants to go ho{oo}me ... but nobody's home.
It's where %nick% lies. Broken inside.
And I will be loathing, loathing %nick% my whole ... life ... long!
Life's too short to <listen to a reckless fool<!| who only ever sees the things they want to seeeee-eee-ee-ee!>|never let you celebrate me<.|: the true queen of the ice and snow!>>
Whoa, whoa. Don't get upset.{ Let's get back on the same page.}
The cold never bothered me, anyway.
For the first time in forever ... nothing's in my wa{aaaa}y!
I never see %nick% anymore.{ {Come out the door. }It's like they've gone away!}
{{All right, that's it! }Dishonour! }Dishonour on your whole family!
Dishonour on you, dishonour on your cow ...
This guy's got 'em scared to death!
My little <baby|%nick%>, off to destroy people.
Fine! Then go ahead and STARVE!
This is bad.{ This is real, real bad.}
What{ did I do{ wrong}}?
<:|=><({((}|D|)>
*party popper*
I didn't mean <it|anything>! COME BACK!{ D:}
<Sorcery|Witchcraft><!|.>
Why is %nick% being so <difficult|/difficult/>?
Please don't slam the door.
Long live the king.
Whoops{ie{s}}.
And DON'T COME BACK!
%nick% ... the tribe has spoken
<Baby|%nick%>{,} don't hurt me<.| ... no more.}>
%nick% has a magic, can't be controlled.
{Sorcery<.|!> }I knew there was something dubious going on here.
Monster. MONSTER!
And I'll rise like the break of dawn!
Let the storm rage <<on|ON>!|on ...>
I'm sorry about this violence. I will add a quart of lutefisk so we have good feelings.
Maybe %nick% has a thing about dirt<!|.>
What's the issue, <dear|%nick%>?
%nick%'s isolation is confirmation of their desperation for human hugs!
We've been falling out for way too long.
I swear I'm through with taking your unshaking %nick%ly suppo{ooooooooo}rt!
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
The party's over. Close the gates.
What did I ever do to you?
Sometimes, I like to close my eyes and imagine what it would be like when %nick% does come.
Probably getting gorgeously tanned in summer.
Do{ooooo}n't let the frostbite ... biiiiiiiiite.
It is not nice to throw {snow}people!
Where'd you guys go? We totally lost %nick% back there.
Oooooooooooooooh, what am I gonna do?
(%nick%'s craaaaaaaaazy.)
Maybe <you are|%nick% is> the prophecy!
I've been so wrong about you!
{Wait. }%nick% can't fly.{ Doesn't make any sense.}
Someday, I'll find my thing.
But I'm more than just the <spare|spaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaa-AAAAAAAAARE>!
Beware the frozen he{aaaaaaaaaaa}art ...
Can't stop, won't stop <m|gro>ovin'.
I can't control the curse!
There's so much fear!
This just got a whole lot harder.
It was an accident!{ I'm sorry, %nick%.}
{Oh, no. }What have I done?
This is getting out of hand!
%nick% have boring meeting.{ Boring manager Rob.}
{%botnick% think }maybe %nick% wanna write goddamn login page themself.
{Anyway, %nick% busy with the telephone. }No time for chat.
%nick% not crazy. Just proud.
Why you gotta be so mean?
%nick% is yelling at a bridesmaid, somewhere back inside a room, wearing a gown shaped like a pastry.
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.
%nick%'s time is running out.{ Speak no{-o}w.}
All my life has been a series of doors in my face.
%nick%'s not just a pretty face.
And I don't know how it gets better than this!
It's <not|'bout> as bad as it could be.
Can only go up from here!
You'll never see me cry!
I was enchanted to meet yo{oooouuuuuuuuuuu}u<.|!>
I got tired of waiting.
This is absurd!
We will be remembered.
And on a Wednesday, at a cafe, I watch it begin again.
{Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay, but I know }I had the best day with you<,| ...> today.
Keep your eyes open.
You don't have to <keep your distance anymore|live in fear>!
No escape from the storm inside of me!
Don't panic.{ We'll make the sun shine bright!}
%nick% very diligent, but their output stink.
I wonder why I didn't see %nick% there before.
True that %nick%'s no Prince Charming, but there's something in them that I simply didn't see.
There goes %nick% with their tray like always.{ The same old bread and rolls to sell.}
Sure. %nick%'s got everything.
Wish I could be part of that world.
{So tell me: }what made %nick% go all ice-crazy?
Didn't %nick%'s parents ever warn them about strangers?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
See you in two weeks<.|!>
Am I really just the spare?
%nick%'s the scholar, athlete, poet. I'm the screwup -- don't I know it.
Of course %nick%'s gonna think I'm just the spare.
Well, I won't care ...
But I just paid it off ...
Somebody's gotta tell %nick%.
I'm gonna cry.
All you know is how to shut people out!
It's like my whole life got turned upside-down.
I'm guessing %nick% doesn't have much experience with heat.
No one wants to be alone. Except maybe %nick%.
That was like a crazy trust exercise.
No returns. No exchanges.
Hang in there, %nick%.
Love will thaw.
If only there was someone out there who loved %nick%.
Wait, what?
Last time I introduced %nick% to a guy, %nick% froze everything.
Yeesh!
Is it just me or did I do really badly back there?
Swooping is bad.
Oh no.
No,{ no,} <not you, too|this can't be happening>!
Nobody hustles %botnick%!
I don't know why you say goodbye when I say hello.
1.21 gigawatts, baby!
Ride the lightning!
I'm gonna have to start keeping score.
Boom!
<X-ray|Tango|Target|Hostile> <down|neutralized|on the move|is <on the move|falling back|no longer a threat>><.|!>
No longer <a threat|standing>.
No way that just happened.
<I'm losing control of the situation|I'M LOSING CONTROL OF THE SITUATION>!
We're really coming down to the wire now.
Terminated.
Welcome to Earth.
Taken care of.
Nice shot.
I can only imagine what %nick% might be doing in an underground facility ...
You may want to exercise restraint when using explosives.
I realize our troops have to put their own survival first, but every alien we use explosives against is one less opportunity to recover new artifacts.
We still haven't had a candidate respond positively to the testing.
If only there was something we could have done ...{ Some aspect of our research that we perhaps overlooked ...}
I thought we had done all we could ... but now, I'm not so sure.
Could we have prevented this tragedy?{ Perhaps we need to refocus our research efforts.}
We lost the bubble.
Incredible .... <It|%nick%> seems to have ... vanished.
Another one down.
Nailed it.
Out of the game.
Please don't freak out<.|!>
Not so tough now, are y<a|ou>?
{Yeah, }you better run.
Hear it not, %nick%, for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven, or to hell.
A little water clears us of this deed.
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
%nick% speaks an infinite deal of nothing.
The quality of %nick% is not strain'd.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
These violent delights have violent ends.
No good deed goes unpunished.
Stay frosty.
Works every time.
%nick% is down! I repeat: %nick% is down!
The heart is not so easily changed.
It's for the best.
Well, that's not my fault.
I'll bring %nick% back and I'll make this right.
Snow. It had to be snow.
Entry is not guaranteed!
Cause no trouble.
Glory to <Arsotzka|%channel%>!
Alles ist gut.
Such a shame.
Didn't see that one coming.
Seatbelts save lives. Buckle up every time.
But you'll come back each time you leave, 'cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream.
And you love the game!
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you.
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ended so suddenly.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in{, so shame on me now}.
Now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground!
%nick% could have been getting down, to this. Sick. Beat!
These things will change ... can feel it now!
These walls that they put up to hold us back <will fall|fell> down!
Repeating history and %nick% is getting sick of it.
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair.
Valar morghulis.
There's a fine line between chaos and a hullabaloo!
A pERfect dAyyy!
Achoo!
