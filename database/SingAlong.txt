Let the storm rage on ...	Let It Go	Frozen	40
My power flurries through the air into the ground!	Let It Go	Frozen	41
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around!	Let It Go	Frozen	42
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast!	Let It Go	Frozen	43
I'm never going back ...	Let It Go	Frozen	44
The past is in the paaaaast!	Let It Go	Frozen	45
Let it go!	Let It Go	Frozen	46
Let it go,	Let It Go	Frozen	47
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.	Let It Go	Frozen	48
Let it go!	Let It Go	Frozen	49
Let it go!	Let It Go	Frozen	50
That perfect girl is gone!	Let It Go	Frozen	51
Here I stand!	Let It Go	Frozen	52
In the light of daaaaaaay!	Let It Go	Frozen	53
Let the storm rage ON!	Let It Go	Frozen	54
The cold never bothered me, anyway.	Let It Go	Frozen	55
Reindeers are better than people. Sven, don't you think that's true?	Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People	Frozen	1
Yeah, people will beat you, and curse you, and cheat you. Everyone of 'em's bad, except you.	Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People	Frozen	2
Oh, thanks, buddy.	Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People	Frozen	3
But people smell better than reindeers. Sven, don't you think I'm right?	Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People	Frozen	4
That's once again true, for all except you.	Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People	Frozen	5
You got me. Let's call it a night.	Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People	Frozen	6
Good night!	Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People	Frozen	7
Don't let the frostbite ... bite ...	Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People	Frozen	8
What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back on such a man?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	1
Is it the clumpy way he walks?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	2
Or the grumpy way he talks?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	3
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped weirdness of his feet?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	4
And though we know he washes well, he always ends up sort of smelly.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	5
But you'll never meet a fellow who's as sensitive and sweet!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	6
So he's a bit of a fixer upper,	Fixer Upper	Frozen	7
So he's got a few flaws.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	8
Like his peculiar brain, dear,	Fixer Upper	Frozen	9
His thing with the reindeer,	Fixer Upper	Frozen	10
That's a little outside of nature's laws!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	11
So he's a bit of a fixer upper, but this we're certain of:	Fixer Upper	Frozen	12
You can fix this fixer upper up with a little bit of love!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	13
Can we please just stop talking about this? We've got a real, actual problem here.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	14
I'll say! So tell me, dear,	Fixer Upper	Frozen	15
Is it the way that he runs scared?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	16
Or that he's socially impaired?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	17
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	18
I did not need to know that.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	19
-- what?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	20
Are you holding back your fondness due to his unmanly blondness?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	21
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	22
He's a bit of a fixer upper.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	23
He's got a couple of bugs.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	24
His isolation is confirmation of his desperation for human hugs!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	25
So he's a bit of a fixer upper, but we know what to do!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	26
The way to fix this fixer upper is to fix him up with you!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	27
ENOUGH! She is engaged to someone else, okay?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	28
... so she's a bit of a fixer upper --	Fixer Upper	Frozen	29
-- that's a minor thing.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	30
Her quote "engagement" is a flex arrangement.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	31
And, by the way, I don't see no ring!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	32
So she's a bit of a fixer upper: her brain's a bit betwixt!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	33
Get the fiance out of the way and the whole thing will be fixed!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	34
But we're not saying you can change him, 'cause people don't really change.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	35
We're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	36
People make bad choices if they're mad, or scared, or stressed.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	37
Throw a little love their way!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	38
And you'll bring out their best -- true love brings out the best!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	39
Throw a little love their way.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	40
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper -- that's what it's all about!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	41
Father!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	42
Sister!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	43
Brother!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	44
We need each other to raise us up and round us out!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	45
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper, but when push comes to shove,	Fixer Upper	Frozen	46
The only fixer upper fixer that can fix up a fixer upper is	Fixer Upper	Frozen	47
True! True!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	48
True, true, true!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	49
Love! True love!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	50
Love, love, love, love, love!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	51
Love!  True love!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	52
True ...	Fixer Upper	Frozen	53
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your troll-fully wedded?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	54
Wait, what?	Fixer Upper	Frozen	55
You're getting married.	Fixer Upper	Frozen	56
Love!	Fixer Upper	Frozen	57
I came all this way today to give us a fresh start,	Life's Too Short	Frozen	1
But now that you're like, wow, it's all, like,	Life's Too Short	Frozen	2
Warm in the heart.	Life's Too Short	Frozen	3
Well this is who I am, welcome to the real me!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	4
You have no idea how great it feels to be free!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	5
We've been falling out for way too long, so let's forget who's right,	Life's Too Short	Frozen	6
And forget who's wrong!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	7
Okay!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	8
Why don't you stay? There's room for family in my cooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuurt!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	9
Cause life's too short!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	10
To always feel shut out and unloved by the sister I long to know.	Life's Too Short	Frozen	11
Life's too short	Life's Too Short	Frozen	12
To never let you see who I am -- the true queen of the ice and snow!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	13
Wo-ho-hoooaaaaa!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	14
I never understood ...	Life's Too Short	Frozen	15
I never understood!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	16
But now, I do!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	17
Life's too short	Life's Too Short	Frozen	18
To miss out on a sister like you.	Life's Too Short	Frozen	19
So you'll come back, then.	Life's Too Short	Frozen	20
Back?	Life's Too Short	Frozen	21
To thaw the fjord, it's frozen over -- no one can get in or out?	Life's Too Short	Frozen	22
Oh.	Life's Too Short	Frozen	23
Sooo ...	Life's Too Short	Frozen	24
I don't believe you!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	25
What? I just assumed that you would have to ...	Life's Too Short	Frozen	26
Then I'll shove on the gloves? That's how your story ends?!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	27
It does! It's just like it was, except for we'll be best friends!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	28
So that's been your plan, to force me back in a cage!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	29
Whoa, whoa! Don't get upset -- let's get back on the same page!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	30
Gee, thanks for coming up to see the place,	Life's Too Short	Frozen	31
And showing off your mastery of tact and grace!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	32
Okay!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	33
Run down the hill and spill my secrets,	Life's Too Short	Frozen	34
Make a full repooooooooort!!!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	35
Bye-bye!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	36
Wait!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	37
Cause life's too short!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	38
There it is! The door you love to slam in my face!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	39
You did well there for a spell, but now you're back in the same place.	Life's Too Short	Frozen	40
Kick me out if you want, but I'm the only one who	Life's Too Short	Frozen	41
Is not one hundred percent convinced the prophecy's you!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	42
You can think whatever you want 'cause I don't caaare!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	43
You're a fool who married a stranger!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	44
That is so unfair!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	45
I swear I'm through with taking your unshaking sisterly	Life's Too Short	Frozen	46
Suppooooort!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	47
Suppooooooooort!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	48
Support!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	49
HAH!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	50
Life's too SHORT!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	51
To let you treat the people down there just as coldly as you always treated me!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	52
La la lalala lalala!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	53
Life's too short!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	54
To listen to a reckless fool who only ever sees the things she wants to see-eee-eeee-eeeee-eee!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	55
You don't know me!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	56
You have no idea!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	57
What I've been throoooouuuugh!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	58
Because of yooooouuuuuu!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	59
Life's too short to waste another minute!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	60
Life's too short to even have you in it!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	61
Life's too SHOOOOOOORRRT!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	62
I've been so wrong about you!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	63
You?! You've been so wrong about everything.	Life's Too Short	Frozen	64
Maybe you are the prophecy!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	65
I am NOT the PROPHECY!	Life's Too Short	Frozen	66
7 AM, the usual morning lineup.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	1
Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all clean.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	2
Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	3
Sweep again, and by then, it's like 7:15!	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	4
And so I'll read a book	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	5
Or maybe two, or three.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	6
I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	7

Then after lunch, it's puzzles and darts and baking ...	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	10
Paper mache, a bit of ballet, and chess ...	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	11
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making ...	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	12
Then I'll stretch,	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	13
Maybe sketch,	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	14
Take a climb,	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	15
Sew a dress!	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	16
And I'll re-read the books,	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	17
If I have time to spare.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	18
I'll paint the walls some more.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	19
I'm sure there's room somewhere!	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	20
And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush, and brush my hair,	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	21
Stuck in the same place I've always been.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	22
And I'll keep wonderin',	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	23
And wonderin',	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	24

And tomorrow night,	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	28
The lights will appear,	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	29
Just like they do on my birthday each year.	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	30
What is it like	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	31
Out there where they glow?	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	32
Now that I'm older,	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	33
Mother might just ... let me go ...	When Will My Life Begin?	Tangled	34
I've got my mother's love -- I shouldn't ask for more.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 1)	Tangled	1
I've got so many things I should be thankful for.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 1)	Tangled	2
Yes, I have everything, except, I guess, a door.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 1)	Tangled	3
Perhaps it's better that I stay in.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 1)	Tangled	4
But tell me ... when will my life begin?	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 1)	Tangled	5
Look it it all, so close, and I'm halfway to it.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	1
Look at it all so big.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	2
Do I even dare?	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	3
Look at me, there at last!	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	4
I just have to do it.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	5
Should I?	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	6
No.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	7
Here I go.	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	8
Just smell the grass, the dirt,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	9
Just like I'd dreamed they'd be!	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	10
Just feel that summer breeze,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	11
The way it's calling me!	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	12
For, like, the first time ever, I'm completely free!	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	13
I could go running,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	14
And racing,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	15
And dancing,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	16
And chasing,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	17
And leaping,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	18
And bounding,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	19
Hair flying,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	20
Heart pounding,	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	21
And splashing!	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	22
And reeling!	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	23
And finally feeling!	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	24
That's when my life begins!	When Will My Life Begin? (Reprise 2)	Tangled	25
Glinda! Is it true you were her friend?	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	1
Well ... it depends what you mean by "friend". I did know her. 	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	2
That is, our paths did cross. At school ...	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	3
Oh, hallowed halls and vine-draped walls	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	4
The proudest sight there is!	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	5
Sight there is!	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	6
When grey and sere our hair hath turned,	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	7
We shall still revere the lessons learned	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	8
In our days at dear old Shiz	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	9
Dear old Shiz!	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	10
Our days at dear old ...	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	11
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhhhl ...	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	12
Dear old Shizzzzz ...	Dear Old Shiz	Wicked	13
Elphaba, why couldn't you stay calm for once, instead of flying off the handle?!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	1
I hope you're happy. I hope you're happy now.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	2
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever. I hope you think you're clever!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	3
I hope you're happy. I hope you're happy, too!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	4
I hope you're proud how you would grovel in submission to feed your own ambition!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	5
So though I can't imagine how, I hope you're happy ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	6
Right.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	7
Now ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	8
Elphie, listen to me.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	9
Just ... say you're sorry. Before it's too late!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	10
You can still be with the Wizard, what you've worked and waited for.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	11
You can have all you've ever wanted ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	12
I know. But I don't want it.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	13
No.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	14
I can't want it ... anymore.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	15
Something has changed within me. Something is not the same.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	16
I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	17
Too late for second guessing.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	18
Too late to go back to sleep.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	19
It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	20
And leap!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	21
It's time to try defying gravity.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	22
I think I'll try defying gravity, and you can't me pull me down!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	23
Can't I make you understand? You're having delusions of grandeur!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	24
I'm through accepting limits 'cause someone says they're so.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	25
Some things I cannot change, but 'til I try I'll never know!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	26
Too long I've been afraid of losing love I guess I've lost.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	27
Well if that's love, it comes at much too high a cost!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	28
I'd sooner buy defying gravity.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	29
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	30
And you can't pull me down!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	31
Glinda, come with me. Think of what we could do, together.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	32
Unlimited.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	33
Together, we're unlimited.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	34
Together, we'll be the greatest team there's ever been, Glinda.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	35
Dreams the way we've planned 'em.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	36
If we work in tandem,	Defying Gravity	Wicked	37
There's no fight we cannot win!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	38
Just you and I defying gravity!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	39
With you and I defying gravity!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	40
They'll never bring us down.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	41
Well, are you coming?	Defying Gravity	Wicked	42
I hope you're happy, now that you're choosing this.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	43
You, too.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	44
I really hope you get it, and that you don't live to regret it!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	45
I hope you're happy in the end!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	46
I hope you're happy ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	47
My ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	48
Frieeeeennnd ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	49
So if you care to find me, look to western sky!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	50
As someone told me lately,	Defying Gravity	Wicked	51
Everyone deserves a chance to fly!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	52
And if I'm flying solo,	Defying Gravity	Wicked	53
At least I'm flying free!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	54
To those who'd ground me,	Defying Gravity	Wicked	55
Take a message back from me!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	56
Tell them how I am defying gravity!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	57
I'm flying high, defying gravity!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	58
And soon, I'll match them in renown.	Defying Gravity	Wicked	59
And nobody in all of Oz,	Defying Gravity	Wicked	60
No wizard that there is or was,	Defying Gravity	Wicked	61
Is ever gonna bring ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	62
ME	Defying Gravity	Wicked	63
DOWN!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	64
I hope you're happy!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	65
Look at her: she's wicked! Get her!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	66
Bring ME DOWN!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	67
No one mourns the wicked! So we've got to bring her ...	Defying Gravity	Wicked	68
Aa-AHHH-aAAAH!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	69
Down!	Defying Gravity	Wicked	70
Elphie, now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project.	Popular	Wicked	1
You really don't have to do that.	Popular	Wicked	2
I know. That's what makes me so nice!	Popular	Wicked	3
Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I,	Popular	Wicked	4
And let's face it -- who isn't less fortunate than I?	Popular	Wicked	5
My tender heart tends to start to bleed,	Popular	Wicked	6
And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over	Popular	Wicked	7
I know, I know, exactly what they need.	Popular	Wicked	8
And even in your case ...	Popular	Wicked	9
Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face!	Popular	Wicked	10
Don't worry! I'm determined to succeed!	Popular	Wicked	11
Follow my lead,	Popular	Wicked	12
And yes, indeed.	Popular	Wicked	13
You ...	Popular	Wicked	14
Will ...	Popular	Wicked	15
Be ...	Popular	Wicked	16
Popular!	Popular	Wicked	17
You're gonna be popular!	Popular	Wicked	18
I'll teach you the proper poise when you talk to boys,	Popular	Wicked	19
Little ways to flirt and flounce! Ooh!	Popular	Wicked	20
I'll show you what shoes to wear,	Popular	Wicked	21
How to fix your hair,	Popular	Wicked	22
Everything that really counts to be popular.	Popular	Wicked	23
I'll help you be popular!	Popular	Wicked	24
You'll hang with the right cohorts,	Popular	Wicked	25
You'll be good at sports,	Popular	Wicked	26
Know the slang you've got to know!	Popular	Wicked	27
So let's start, 'cause you've got an awfully long way to go ...	Popular	Wicked	28
Don't be offended by my frank analysis:	Popular	Wicked	29
Think of it as personality dialysis!	Popular	Wicked	30
Now that I've chosen to become a pal, a sis	Popular	Wicked	31
ter and advisor, there's nobody wiser!	Popular	Wicked	32
Not when it comes to popular.	Popular	Wicked	33
I know about popular.	Popular	Wicked	34
And with an assist from me to be who you'll be,	Popular	Wicked	35
Instead of dreary who-you-were.	Popular	Wicked	36
Well, are.	Popular	Wicked	37
There's nothing that can stop you	Popular	Wicked	38
From becoming popu-ler.	Popular	Wicked	39
Lar!	Popular	Wicked	40
Laaaaa, laaaaa!	Popular	Wicked	41
Laaaaa, laaaaa.	Popular	Wicked	42
We're gonna make you popular.	Popular	Wicked	43
When I see depressing creatures with unprepossessing features,	Popular	Wicked	44
I remind them on their own behalf	Popular	Wicked	45
To.	Popular	Wicked	46
Think.	Popular	Wicked	47
Of.	Popular	Wicked	48
Celebrated heads of state or especially great communicators:	Popular	Wicked	49
Did they have brains or knowledge?	Popular	Wicked	50
Don't make me laugh!	Popular	Wicked	51
They were popular! Please.	Popular	Wicked	52
It's all about popular!	Popular	Wicked	53
It's not about aptitude.	Popular	Wicked	54
It's the way you're viewed.	Popular	Wicked	55
So it's very shrewd to be	Popular	Wicked	56
Very, very popular like me!	Popular	Wicked	57
Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you. You're beautiful.	Popular	Wicked	58
I have to go ...	Popular	Wicked	59
You're welcome!	Popular	Wicked	60
And though you protest your disinterest,	Popular	Wicked	61
I know clandestinely ...	Popular	Wicked	62
You're gonna grin and bear it, your newfound popularity!	Popular	Wicked	63
Laaaaa, laaaaa!	Popular	Wicked	64
Laaaaa, laaaaa!	Popular	Wicked	65
You'll be popular!	Popular	Wicked	66
Just not quite as popular	Popular	Wicked	67
As ...	Popular	Wicked	68
Meeeeeee!	Popular	Wicked	69
Oh, Miss Elphaba ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	1
Many years I have waited	The Wizard and I	Wicked	2
For a gift like yours to appear	The Wizard and I	Wicked	3
Why, I predict the Wizard could make you his	The Wizard and I	Wicked	4
Magic grand vizier!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	5
My dear, my dear,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	6
I'll write at once to the Wizard	The Wizard and I	Wicked	7
Tell him of you in advance.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	8
With a talent like yours, dear,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	9
There is a defin-ish chance	The Wizard and I	Wicked	10
If you work as you should,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	11
You'll be making good ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	12
Did that really just happen?	The Wizard and I	Wicked	13
Have I actually understood?	The Wizard and I	Wicked	14
This weird quirk I've tried to suppress or hide	The Wizard and I	Wicked	15
Is a talent that could ... help me meet the Wizard!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	16
If I make good.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	17
So I'll make ... good ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	18
When I meet the Wizard,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	19
Once I prove my worth,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	20
And then I meet the Wizard	The Wizard and I	Wicked	21
What I've waited for since -- since birth!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	22
And with all his Wizard wisdom,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	23
By my looks, he won't be blinded.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	24
Do you think the Wizard is dumb?	The Wizard and I	Wicked	25
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded? No.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	26
He'll say to me, "I see who you truly are:"	The Wizard and I	Wicked	27
A girl on whom I can rely!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	28
And that's how we'll begin,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	29
The Wizard and I ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	30
Once I'm with the Wizard,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	31
My whole life will change.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	32
null	The Wizard and I	Wicked	33
No one thinks you're strange!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	34
No father is not proud of you.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	35
No sister acts ashamed.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	36
And all of Oz has to love you	The Wizard and I	Wicked	37
When by the Wizard, you're acclaimed.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	38
And this gift or this curse I have inside	The Wizard and I	Wicked	39
Maybe at last I'll know why.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	40
When we are hand in hand -- the Wizard and I!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	41
And one day, he'll say to me, "Elphaba,"	The Wizard and I	Wicked	42
A girl who is so superior,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	43
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside ... 	The Wizard and I	Wicked	44
Have a matching exterior?	The Wizard and I	Wicked	45
And since folks here, to an absurd degree,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	46
Seem fixated on your verdigris,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	47
Would it be alright by you ... 	The Wizard and I	Wicked	48
If I ... de-greenify you?	The Wizard and I	Wicked	49
And though, of course, that's not important to me,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	50
Alright, why not? I'll reply!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	51
Oh, what a pair we'll be,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	52
The Wizard and I ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	53
Yes, what a pair we'll be,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	54
The Wizard and ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	55
Unlimited.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	56
My future is unlimited.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	57
And I've just had a vision almost like a prophecy ... I know.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	58
It sounds truly crazy.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	59
And true, the vision's hazy.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	60
But I swear, someday there'll be	The Wizard and I	Wicked	61
A celebration throughout Oz	The Wizard and I	Wicked	62
That's all to do ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	63
With meeeeeee-eee-ee!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	64
And I'll stand there with the Wizard!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	65
Feeling things I've never felt!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	66
And though I'd never show it,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	67
I'll be so happy, I could melt!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	68
And so it will be for the rest of my life,	The Wizard and I	Wicked	69
And I'll want nothing else 'til I die!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	70
Held in such high esteem.	The Wizard and I	Wicked	71
When people see me, they will scream ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	72
For half of Oz's favourite teeeaaaaam!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	73
The Wizard ...	The Wizard and I	Wicked	74
And I!	The Wizard and I	Wicked	75
Is this the real life?	Bohemian Rhapsody	Queen	1

Ticking away	Time	Pink Floyd	1
The moments that make up a dull day.	Time	Pink Floyd	2
Fritter and waste	Time	Pink Floyd	3
The hours in an off-hand way.	Time	Pink Floyd	4
Kicking around	Time	Pink Floyd	5
On a piece of ground	Time	Pink Floyd	6
In your hometown.	Time	Pink Floyd	7
Waiting for someone	Time	Pink Floyd	8
Or something	Time	Pink Floyd	9
To show you the way.	Time	Pink Floyd	10
Tired of lying in the sunshine,	Time	Pink Floyd	11
Staying home to watch the rain.	Time	Pink Floyd	12
You are young and life is long,	Time	Pink Floyd	13
And there is time to kill today.	Time	Pink Floyd	14
And then one day, you find	Time	Pink Floyd	15
Ten years have got behind you	Time	Pink Floyd	16
No one told you when to run.	Time	Pink Floyd	17
You missed the starting gun.	Time	Pink Floyd	18
*bwaaaaang*	Time	Pink Floyd	19
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun,	Time	Pink Floyd	20
But it's sinking.	Time	Pink Floyd	21
Racing around	Time	Pink Floyd	22
To come up behind you again.	Time	Pink Floyd	23
The sun is the same in a relative way,	Time	Pink Floyd	24
But you're older.	Time	Pink Floyd	25
Shorter of breath,	Time	Pink Floyd	26
And one day closer to death!	Time	Pink Floyd	27
Every year is getting shorter.	Time	Pink Floyd	28
Never seem to find the time.	Time	Pink Floyd	29

On Loch Etive, they have worked	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	34
With their highland dreams.	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	35
By Kilcrennan, they have nourished	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	36
In the mountain streams.	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	37
And in searching for acceptance,	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	38
They had given it away.	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	39
Only the children of their children	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	40
Know the price they had to pay.	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	41
And in darkness, we do what we can.	Turning Away	Dougie Maclean	42

Tis's the story	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	1
Of a great man, Markyus.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	2
He brought us the freedom --	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	3
Now I give you the news.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	4
Both Muslims and Christians	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	5
Hoped to count with him,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	6
But our beloved hero,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	7
He didn't give in.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	8
You're not telling the whole story!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	9
Wait, who are you?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	10
We're time travelers from the future, and we bring our new sounds with us.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	11
Madness!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	12
From the N, to the U, to the D-G-E --	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	13
That's me.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	14
Get ready.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	15
Gimme the mike and I will burst your bubble.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	16
When Markyus is in your team, you know you are in no trouble.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	17
But what if he's in every team? You've just seen	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	18
He's gonna mess you up 'til you can't even scream.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	19
He was born with a mission,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	20
A mission of peace,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	21
But he ain't liked his condition --	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	22
He said, Screw the police.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	23
Let's break this game just for the sake of it.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	24
He began receiving offers so he checked if he could profit.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	25
So should I join the Queen?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	26
Or should I join the Sultan?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	27
Should I join no one or will they find that insulting?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	28
Maybe I should play with both, but for neither.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	29
I'll go to church and to the mosque just to see what I can see there.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	30
His crazy mind plotted a crazy plan:	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	31
To kill every fighter in the Holy Land.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	32
And he helped the people,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	33
And he refused to lose.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	34
That's why I'm singing today about the feats of you, Markyus.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	35
Tis's the story	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	36
Of a great man, Markyus.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	37
He brought us the freedom --	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	38
Now I give you the news.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	39
Both Muslims and Christians	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	40
Hoped to count with him,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	41
But our beloved hero,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	42
He didn't give in.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	43
Hey, that's exactly what I sang before! What's this sorcery?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	44
We recorded you in our cassette tape, then played it again!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	45
A ... magic box!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	46
Yeah, a magic box ...	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	47
Now ...	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	48
Bagpipe solo!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	49
*BAGPIPE SOLO*	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	50
Let's get it on again with the great story	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	51
Of a really great man and his quest for glory.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	52
One by one, they all began to fall.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	53
Cries of terror beside the Wailing Wall.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	54
Wait!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	55
What?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	56
Let me do a verse, please!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	57
You think ya got the flow?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	58
I--I don't know what you're talking about.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	59
Go ahead -- make me proud.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	60
I'm going to make you proud.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	61
I'm going to say it loud,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	62
Because my rhymes are good and I'm a man from da hood.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	63
No, you can't say that.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	64
Why?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	65
Because it's--it's not believable.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	66
I see ...	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	67
I'm Bartholomew,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	68
The Bard from Jerusalem,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	69
And as I see it, this was a battle between us and them.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	70
We were just townies -- they had the power.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	71
Do you hear me, guys, or do I have to speak louder?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	72
By the way,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	73
That's a rhetorical question.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	74
Did I mention that Markyus is a champion?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	75
He was always there, and he helped me kill my rival.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	76
It wasn't a matter of honour; it was a matter of survival.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	77
But to be frank,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	78
I--I didn't like his plan at first.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	79
His ideas were good, I mean,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	80
I've seen worse.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	81
But I felt bad for the warriors fighting out there	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	82
Dying for their faiths, but Markyus didn't care.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	83
And he planned every move very carefully	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	84
Because one misstep could mean the end of him.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	85
But he did no wrong, that's why we're singing this song --	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	86
Though I feel this verse has gone on for too long.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	87
Tis's the story	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	88
Of a great man, Markyus.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	89
He brought us the freedom --	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	90
Now I give you the news.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	91
Both Muslims and Christians	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	92
Hoped to count with him,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	93
But our beloved hero,	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	94
He didn't give in.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	95
That wasn't too shabby, Bartholomew, you know whattamsayin'?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	96
You have what's needed to be a rapper.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	97
Now go out there and spread the word of hip hop.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	98
The word of what? Is that like--like a new God or something?	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	99
In a way ... yes. Yes, it is.	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	100
I'll do my best, you magical people!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	101
Goodbye!	Crusades Rap	NudgeNudge	102
