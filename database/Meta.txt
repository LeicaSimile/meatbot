All my life has been a series of doors in my face, so I don't know what you just said.	takes a bow.	stops{,} dead{ in the middle of its <performance|show>}.	What.	exits the stage.
Maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue, but what is this request by you?	drops the mic{{ on a <sad|<tragical|outrageous|infuriating>ly happy> <puppy|orphan|smiley face>} and walks away}.	{reluctantly }goes back into hibernation{ nation}.
I've been searching my whole life to find your request, and maybe it's the party talking, but I don't know the rest.	<flie|flutter>s away.	
I see your text, and it's nothing like I've known before! Really.		
What do you mean by that? What do I not know?		
What is this you mentioned? Fervid as a flame ... does it have a name?		
Unlimited. My future is unlimited. But unfortunately, my current song database isn't.		
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know ... that I don't know!{ ... whoops.}		
Makes me want to turn around and <sing|find> it, but I don't know nothin' 'bout that.		
I've been dreaming of a song like this, and the lyrics that I seem to miss.		
How would I knooow what that is? How would I knooow that song?		
I said, "I want something <that you want|I don't have>. Something that you told me here to sing."

Why couldn't my owner have added more songs, instead flying off the handle? I hope she's happy.		
I hope my owner's happy how she hurt her cause forever -- I hope she thinks she's clever!		
So though I can't imagine how, I hope Meat adds this ... right ... now.		
I hope you're happy, now that you're choosing this ... I don't know what that is{, but I really hope I get it, and you don't live to regret it}.		
Whenever I see something I don't fully recognize, -- and let's face it: what is it that I fully recognize? -- my tender heart tends to start to bleed.
