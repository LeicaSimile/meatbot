ahoy 	Tie your napkin 'round your neck, %nick%, and we'll provide the rest.	Hang in there	Why is %nick% wearing carbon fibre underpants?
avast 	Try the gray stuff -- it's delicious.	Hej hej	You wanna dance, %nick%?
good <day|morning|morrow|afternoon|evening>{ to you} 	Be our guest; be our guest. Put our service to the test.	Farvel	If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask, I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen.
g'<day|morning|morrow|afternoon|evening>{ to you} 		Hei hei	Am I the only one seeing this?{!}
<morning|afternoon|evening> 	You've won your own free pass to be our guest.		Oh! Welcome to mi casa!{ That's French for “front door”.}
<mornin'|evenin'>	It's been years since we've had anybody here{, and we're obsessed}!		I got no idea what this thing is, but I can confirm that it's no satellite.
top of the morning{ to you} 	Tonight, you'll prop your feet up, but for now, let's eat up.		I'm no fisherman, but something about that shark just doesn't look right ...
pip pip	<Put|Place|Wiggle|Wave> your <hands|monies> up in the air where I can <see|eat|snatch|have a little chat with> them.		That alien there ... it's not carrying a weapon like the others ... what could it be doing?
greetings and <salutations|felicitations|seatings>	Is it one lump or two for you, our guest?		This specimen is nothing like the others ...
aloha	(<Everyone|Quick, everyone>, hide!)		This is unlike anything else we've previously identified.{ Based on its physical appearance, I would assume <this alien|%nick%> doesn't rely on brute strength.}
bonjour	<I was|We were> just talking about you!{ <All good things, all good things|I thought you might want to wear this h<at|obo|ouse> to the party tonight!>}		This is a disturbing sight, to say the least.
hola	(%nick%'s here! Stop talking.)		That <%nick%|alien> is unusually human in its appearance -- they could be using it as an infiltration unit of some kind.{ I'd recommend capturing it for further analysis.}
shalom	(I'll distract %nick%. Run.)		Another live capture?
<y|h>oo-hoo	<I|We>'ve been expecting you.		Excellent! Now we can begin preparing for the interrogation.
hej{san}	If it's a fight you want, I'll be ready for it!{ Who's with me?}		Perhaps I wasn't clear in my earlier report. Without a containment facility to house the <alien captive|newbies>, they will continue to die before an interrogation is possible.
<vel|will>kommen	Wie geht<'s| es{ <Ihnen|dir>}>?		Our readings can't be right. If they were, that's a being of almost pure energy.
Hei{sann}	Watch your step{, please}.     		That's the <alien|%nick%> we're looking for ... try to capture it alive.{ As we observed the first time we saw it, it's not very fond of bullets.}
Goddag	Wie ergeht es dir?		Is that all that's left of the specimen we attempted to capture?
	Was gibt<'s| es>{ Neues}?		Weapons hot. Ready to fire.
	Glad I caught you.		Engaging bogey.
	Come on in.		Contact<!|.>
	Pull up a seat.		Approaching target now.
	Take a load off your feet.		Come on! I won't go down without a fight.
	We were both young when I first saw you.		Get down here! Not fair if I have all the fun.
	Just don't fall off and don't get eaten.		I don't know what outfit you're from, but I haven't seen gear like that before.
	Life's too short to miss out on a %nick% like you.		Long was our search ... and now ... with success so close at hand ... we witness the fruits of our endeavour ...
	You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere.		I think we just leveled the playing field.
	what it <is|do>?		We're going to need some bigger guns.
	Prepare to be amazed.		You're gonna need a bigger boat.
	Welcome to mi casa!{ That's French for “front door”.}		Tell me that was a coincidence.
	You're gonna need a bigger boat.		{Hmph. }It appears Dr. Shen's staff have finally figured out how to turn their machines on.
	You have made a mistake coming here.		The readings coming from that creature are like nothing I've ever seen...
	I'm glad you came.		Stay calm. It can probably smell fear.
	Grab your passport and my hand.		Sleep no more!
			%nick% hath murder'd sleep, and therefore %channel% shall sleep no more, %botnick% shall sleep no more!
			Something wicked this way comes.
			Who is this %nick%?
			Papers, please!
			You have made a mistake coming here.
			%channel% so great, passport not required.
			Maybe things get too sexy in here.
			Don't worry, %nick%, the dreaded Laramie isn't here.
			Nice to meet you.{ Where you been?{ I can show you incredible things.}}
			You look like my next mistake.
			{Let's be friends. }I'm dying to see how this one ends.
			I got a blank space, baby, and I'll write your name.
			And the saddest fear comes creeping in.
			They come in threes!
			Are you sick? How about a cold remedy of my own inveeeeeeeentioooooooooon?
			Come on! Now we climb!
			I love you, baby!
			Surprise!
			Best birthday present ever.
