When my love swears that she is made of truth,	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	1	2
I do believe her though I know she lies,	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	2	2
That she might think me some untutored youth,	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	3	2
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	4	3
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	5	2
Although she knows my days are past the best,	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	6	2
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	7	2
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	8	3
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	9	3
And wherefore say not I that I am old?	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	10	3
O love's best habit is in seeming trust,	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	11	2
And age in love loves not to have years told.	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	12	3
Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	13	2
And in our faults by lies we flattered be.	Sonnet 138	William Shakespeare	14	4
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	1	2
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	2	1.5
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	3	2
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	4	3
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	5	2
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	6	2
And every fair from fair sometime declines,	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	7	2
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	8	3
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	9	1.8
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	10	2
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	11	2
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	12	2.5
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	13	3
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.	Sonnet 18	William Shakespeare	14	4

For years, she stayed inside her room all day	Elsa	MeatBot	1	2
To keep the gift and curse within controlled.	Elsa	MeatBot	2	2.5
For years, she knew she had to keep away,	Elsa	MeatBot	3	2
Protect them from the bitter winter cold.	Elsa	MeatBot	4	3
For years, she kept it all concealed in fear,	Elsa	MeatBot	5	2
And though she'd hear her sister plead outside,	Elsa	MeatBot	6	2
For years, she closed herself when they came near.	Elsa	MeatBot	7	2.5
She had lost all on whom she had relied.	Elsa	MeatBot	8	3
Then finally, one day, she let it go.	Elsa	MeatBot	9	3
That day, she stood atop a mountain, high.	Elsa	MeatBot	10	2
That day, she rose a queen of ice and snow.	Elsa	MeatBot	11	2
That day, she looked upon the western sky.	Elsa	MeatBot	12	2
At last, she had the freedom to create,	Elsa	MeatBot	13	3
And then at last, she opened up the gate.	Elsa	MeatBot	14	4
