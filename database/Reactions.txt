tries the gray stuff -- it's delicious -- and goes on to ask %nick%'s dishes.	I don't have a skull. Or bones.			
unfolds its menu, takes a glance, and then becomes %nick%'s guest{, oui, %nick%'s guest, becomes %nick%'s guest}.	You want thingamabobs? I've got %nick%. But who cares? No big deal. I want more.			
prepares and serves with flair -- a culinary cabaret!	What's a %nick%? And why does it ... what's the word ... burn?			
lifts its glass, having won a free pass to be %nick%'s guest.	%nick% alone is not enough. You need both together. Winter, summer, moon, and sun -- lesson number one.			
suggests fine dining to %nick%, if %nick%'s stressed.	I love <%nick%|you> mo<re|st>.			
belts out sunlight-shimmering love to %nick%.	You hesitated.

places on %nick% a <magic|curse> most <fair|foul>, subjecting %nick% to a life of <sunshine and lollipops|happy, smiling people|death>.	No one fights like %nick%, douses lights like %nick%; in a wrestling match, nobody bites like %nick%!			
carves a racial epitaph on %nick%'s <grave|tomb>stone.	No one shoots like %nick%, makes those beauts like %nick%, then goes tromping around wearing boots like %nick%!			
sees %nick% doing the impossible, concluding that %nick% is practically unstoppable and totally untoppable.	Most days, I just lay around the castle flabby, fat, and lazy. <You|%nick%> walked in and oops-a-daisy!			
suddenly bumps into %nick%.	Who is that %nick% I see staring straight back at me?			
<explodes|shatters>{ %nick%'s <Teletubbies|pillow cases|lucky <mirror|charms>>{ in a fit of {righteous }<anger|fury|boredom>}}.	Why is my %nick% someone I don't know?			
dances through <life|%nick%>, <mindless and careless|skimming the surface|swaying and sweeping>.	Did they send me %nick% when I asked for sons?			
shows %nick% what shoes to wear, how to fix their hair, and everything that really counts to be popular.	I know it all ends tomorrow, so it has to be today!			
makes %nick% its magic grand vizier.	Yellow punch %nick%! No punch-backs.			
<eman|radi>ates unadulterated loathing{<, fervid as a flame,| in such total detestation>} for %nick%'s <face|voice|clothing>.	%nick% can do the things that can't be done. %nick% can win the fights that can't be won.

bumps its <horse|lemon> into %nick%.	{There's been some confusion, for you see, }%nick% is unusually and exceedingly peculiar, and, altogether, quite impossible to describe.			
loses itself in a daydream.	Dear %nick%, you are just too good. How do you stand it? I don't think I could.

throws its phone across the room at %nick%.	So! What's the most <swankified|awful|placified|non-existent> place in town?			
asks %nick% to dance right there, in the middle of the parking lot.	Was %nick% born <great, or was greatness|wicked, or was wickedness|mad, or was madness> thrust upon them?			
drives %nick% up the wall.	{Now, }has anybody any clever questions for your guide?{ For a penny more, go on and ask; I have nothing here to hide.}			
jumps then falls into %nick%.	If insanity's primarily a %nick%-ish malady,{ and no-one's doubting that for it's a scientific fact,} then according to the medics, has %nick% faultier genetics?{ Was %nick% born with this disease, or is it something you'd contract?}			
stands by, waiting at %nick%'s backdoor.	%nick%'s practically wild, sir{ -- protect your child, sir}.			
braces itself for the goodbye.	That's nice.{ Marie! The baguettes! Hurry up!}			
has the kingdom lights shine just for %nick%.	It's a pity and a sin: %nick% doesn't quite fit in.			
throws its head back, laughing like a little kid.	Sounds perfect!			
tries to picture itself without %nick%, but it can't.	I say, why invite stressing?

Probably <not important|something <lame|meant to be broken>>}|My fail-safe failed>.{ Why do you guys look {so }{<infuriatingly|annoyingly> }squishy all of a sudden?}

rocketpunches %nick%{ to oblivion}.	If at first you don't succeed, <lie, lie again.|ask, "Why again?">

	{Well, }that's not my fault<.|!>			
	Shush! I'm trying to listen!			
	Cutie! I'm going to <eat|keep> you.{ <:)|:D|^{_}^>}			
	Actually, about that ...{ wait. What was that?}			
	No, we can't.{ Goodbye, %nick%.}			
	I'm just trying to protect <%nick%|you>!			
	Whoa ... so this is %nick%.{ I love it.{ Ooh, but don't touch it!}}			
	%nick% is putting someone else's needs before yours, like how <I|you> didn't.			
	I was born ready!{ Yes!}			
	If I kissed <%nick% and held %nick%|myself and held myself> tenderly, there's no sea monster big enough that'd ever frighten me!			
	Then leave.			
	Give me my glove!			
	{%nick%, please, please! }I can't live like this anymore!			
	<Enough|/Enough/>, %nick%.			
	I said ENOUGH!			
	I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart, but you've got being right down to an art.			
	You be the prince and I'll be the princess.			
	May I talk to you, please? Alone?			
	%nick%, what do you know about true love?			
	You don't know how nice that is, but I do.			
	You almost set me on fire!			
	Get ready to jump, %nick%!			
	You slipped on ice.			
	Bring me my horse.			
	No, don't touch me!{ Please.{ I don't want to hurt you.}}			
	Are you satisfied with your care?			
	We jumped out a *<window|winnnndowwwwww>*!			
	I cannot be sick. I am a robot.			
	You will be alright.{ There, there.}			
	I am not fast.			
	This may undermine my non-threatening, huggable design.			
	On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your pain?			
	Does it hurt when I touch it?			
	You have fallen.			
	It is alright to cry.{ Crying is a natural response to pain.}			
	I will scan you for injuries.			
	We could be {immOOOooooOOoooor, }immortals!			
	I'm still comparing your past to my future.			
	They say we are what we are, but we don't have to be.			
	I'm bad behaviour, but I do it in the best way!			
	I would never shut you out.			
	Look at %nick%, trying to kiss my nose. I like you, too!			
	I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair!			
	Does it look bad?			
	No, no. You've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be face up!			
	Do me a favour: grab my butt!			
	Alright, I'm just blocking you out 'cause I've gotta concentrate here.			
	The only frozen heart around here is yours.			
	All men do it.			
	Foot size doesn't matter.			
	Vat did you call me?			
	Don't you see?{ I can't.}			
	This is not making much of a difference, is it?			
	Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear.			
	My programming prevents me from injuring a human being.			
	You gave me a heart attack!			
	Which means ... what?			
	Stopstopstop, stop! It's just an expression!			
	{I'm shaking things up! }You need to look at it from a different angle.			
	Seriously, what's the plan?			
	Let's briefly put on manly readiness.			
	Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.			
	Arsotzka still best country for sure.			
	Oh man, you funny guy!			
	%nick% very bad cook. But if I do not eat, %nick% get angry.			
	You can walk away, say we don't need this ... but there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this!			
	They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared!			
	But I believe in whatever you do ... and I'll do anything to see it through{, because these things will change}!			
	Why'd you strip?			
	I am Groot.			
	%nick%, I'm thinking you might have a cold.			
	Just follow the string!			
	Follow the string to the thing!			
	If someone wants to hold you back, I'd like to see them try.			
	I'm making today a perfect day for you!			
	I'm fine.			
	Wow, you've got me reeling, but I'm still concerned for you.			
	%nick%, you've got to go lie down.			
	We're making today a special day!			
	Come on! Now we cliiiiiiiimb!			
	Alright, we can't go on like this.{ Let's put this day on hold.}			
	{Okay ... }I have a cold.			
	But you need medical attention.			
	Come on. Admit it to yourself.			
	I don't get colds.{ Besides, a cold never bothered me anyway.}			
	We are not stopping because the next one is the be--ACHOO!			
	We need to get to our birthday chills. I mean, thrills!			
	For everything you are to me and all you've been through, I'm making today a perfect day for youuuuuu!			
	I love you, too.			
	I can make a bad guy good for the weekend.			
	But it's ice cream cake!			
	%nick%, you're melting!			
	Relax! It looks great!			
	I just want it to be perfect!			
	What could happen? It's all set.			
	I can't read.{ Or spell.}
