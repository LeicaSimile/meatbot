1	Frozen	Ice harvester		Beautiful, powerful, dangerous, cold! Ice has a magic, can't be controlled.
2	Frozen	Anna		The sky's awake, so I'm awake, so we have to play!
3	Frozen	Elsa		Go play by yourself.
4	Frozen	Anna		Do you wanna build a snowmaaaaan?
5	Frozen	King Adgar		Elsa, what have you done? This is getting out of hand!
6	Frozen	Elsa		It was an accident! I'm sorry, Anna.
7	Frozen	Bulda		Shush! I'm trying to listen!
8	Frozen	Bulda		Cuties. I'm gonna keep you!
9	Frozen	Grand Pabbie		The heart is not so easily changed. But the head can be persuaded.
10	Frozen	Grand Pabbie		You must learn to control it, or fear will be your enemy.
11	Frozen	Anna		I think some company is overdue. I've started talking to the pictures on the walls! (Hang in there, Joan.)
12	Frozen	King Adgar		Getting upset only makes it worse. Calm down!
13	Frozen 	Elsa		No, don't touch me! Please! I don't want to hurt you.
14	Frozen	Anna		See you in two weeks!
15	Frozen	Elsa		Do you have to go?
16	Frozen	Anna		We only have each other. It's just you and me. What are we gonna do?
17	Frozen	Boy who doesn't like his clothes		That's not my fault.
18	Frozen	Kristoff		Ah, ah-ah-ah! Share!
19	Frozen	Duke of Weselton		Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches! ... did I say that out loud?
20	Frozen	Anna		My sister's ... corneration ...
21	Frozen	Anna		Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?
22	Frozen	Anna		Why have a ballroom with no balls?
23	Frozen	Anna		Don't know if I'm elated or gassy, but I'm somewhere in that zone!
24	Frozen	Anna		Tonight imagine me, gown and all, fetchingly draped against the wall: the picture of sophisticated graaaaaace!
25	Frozen	Anna		I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!
26	Frozen	Anna		But for the first time in forever ... at least I've got a chance.
27	Frozen	Elsa		Don't let them in. Don't let them see. Be the good girl you always have to be.
28	Frozen	Elsa		Conceal. Don't feel.
29	Frozen	Elsa		Make one wrong move and everyone will know.
30	Frozen	Elsa		Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know!
31	Frozen	Anna		I know it all ends tomorrow, so it has to be today!
32	Frozen	Anna		For the first time in forever ... nothing's in my waaaaaay!
33	Frozen	Anna		This is awkward. Not you're awkward, but just 'cause we're—I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait, what?
34	Frozen	Anna		I mean, if you hit my sister Elsa, it would be—yeesh! 'cause, you know.
35	Frozen	Hans		Just you?
36	Frozen	Anna		You look beautifuller! I mean, not fuller. You don't look fuller, but more—more beautiful.
37	Frozen	Anna		It's warmer than I thought.
38	Frozen	Elsa		What is that amazing smell?
39	Frozen	Elsa		Thank you ... only I don't dance. But my sister does.
40	Frozen	Duke of Weselton		If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you!
41	Frozen	Duke of Weselton		Alright, hang on! They don't call me the Little Dipper for nothing!
42	Frozen	Duke of Weselton		Like a chicken with the face of a monkey, I fly!
43	Frozen	Hans		Glad I caught you.
44	Frozen	Anna		Your physique helps, I'm sure, too!
45	Frozen	Hans		It's what brothers do.
46	Frozen	Hans		I would never shut you out.
47	Frozen	Anna		Okay, can I just say something crazy?
48	Frozen	Hans		I love crazy.
49	Frozen	Anna		All my life has been a series of doors in my face, and then suddenly I bump into you.
50	Frozen	Anna		Sandwiches!
51	Frozen	Hans		That's what I was gonna say!
52	Frozen	Elsa		I'm sorry. I'm confused.
53	Frozen	Elsa		Slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married.
54	Frozen	Elsa		May I talk to you, please? Alone?
55	Frozen	Elsa		You can't marry a man you just met.
56	Frozen	Anna		All you know is how to shut people out!
57	Frozen	Elsa		The party is over. Close the gates.
58	Frozen	Anna		No, why? Why do you shut me out? Why do you shut the world out? What are you so AFRAID of?!
59	Frozen	Duke of Weselton		Sorcery! I knew there was something dubious going on here.
60	Frozen	Anna		She's my sister. She would never hurt me.
61	Frozen	Elsa		The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.
62	Frozen	Elsa		Couldn't keep it in. Heaven knows I tried.
63	Frozen	Elsa		Well now, they know!
64	Frozen	Elsa		Let the storm rage on ... the cold never bothered me, anyway.
65	Frozen	Elsa		It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small.
66	Frozen	Elsa		It's time to see what I can do, to test the limits and break through!
67	Frozen	Elsa		I am one with the wind and sky!
68	Frozen	Elsa		You'll never see me cry!
69	Frozen	Elsa		I'm never going back ... the past is in the past!
70	Frozen	Elsa		And I'll rise like the break of dawn!
71	Frozen	Elsa		That perfect girl is gone!
72	Frozen	Anna		Snow. It had to be snow. She couldn't have had tr-tropical magic that covered the f-fjords in white sand and warm ... fire!
73	Frozen	Oaken		Hoo-hoo! Big summer blowout! Half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention.
74	Frozen	Oaken		Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear.
75	Frozen	Anna		Did it seem ... magical?
76	Frozen	Oaken		Vat did you call me?
77	Frozen	Oaken		I'm sorry about this violence. I will add a quart of lutefisk so we'll have good feelings.
78	Frozen	Kristoff		Reindeers are better than people.
79	Frozen	Kristoff		Don't let the frostbite ... bite ...
80	Frozen	Kristoff		I don't take people places.
81	Frozen	Anna		We leave now. Right now.
82	Frozen	Kristoff		Hang on. We like to go fast.
83	Frozen	Anna		I like fast!
84	Frozen	Anna		But the thing is, she wore these gloves all the time. So I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt!
85	Frozen	Kristoff		Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
86	Frozen	Anna		Foot size doesn't matter.
87	Frozen	Anna		Excuse me, sir, he is a /prince/.
88	Frozen	Kristoff		All men do it.
89	Frozen	Kristoff		Just don't fall off and don't get eaten.
90	Frozen	Kristoff		Who marries a man she just met?
91	Frozen	Anna		It's TRUE LOVE!
92	Frozen	Kristoff		You almost set me on fire!
93	Frozen	Kristoff		But I just paid it off ...
94	Frozen	Sven		But you won't get your new sled if she's dead!
95	Frozen	Anna		Sure! I'll let you tag along!
96	Frozen	Anna		I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
97	Frozen	Olaf		No, not yellow. Yellow and snow? No go.
98	Frozen	Olaf		Wait, what am I looking at here right now? Why are you all hanging off the earth like a bat?
99	Frozen	Olaf		It's like my whole life got turned upside-down.
100	Frozen	Olaf		I've always wanted a nose! It's like a little baby unicorn ...
101	Frozen	Olaf		Hi, everyone. I'm Olaf, and I like warm hugs!
102	Frozen	Olaf		Look at him, trying to kiss my nose. I like you, too!
103	Frozen	Olaf		Yeah, why?
104	Frozen	Olaf		I don't know why, but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot ...
105	Frozen	Kristoff		I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
106	Frozen	Olaf		But sometimes, I like to close my eyes and imagine what it's like when summer does come.
107	Frozen	Olaf		Bees will buzz, kids will blow dandelion fuzz, and I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.
108	Frozen	Olaf		A drink in my hand, my snow against the burning sand, probably getting gorgeously tanned in summer.
109	Frozen	Olaf		Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer!
110	Frozen	Olaf		Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle, but put me in summer and I'll be a ... happy snowman!
111	Frozen	Olaf		When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin' off steam.
112	Frozen	Kristoff		I'm gonna tell him.
113	Frozen	Anna		Don't you dare!
114	Frozen	Kristoff		Somebody's gotta tell him.
115	Frozen	Bark-up master race		No, no, you've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be face up!
116	Frozen	Bark-down master race		Bark down is drier!
117	Frozen	Olaf		I bet she's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever.
118	Frozen	Olaf		Oh, look at that. I've been impaled.
119	Frozen	Kristoff		I wouldn't put my foot there.
120	Frozen	Anna		Alright, I'm just blocking you out 'cause I've gotta concentrate here.
121	Frozen	Anna		No one wants to be alone. Except maybe you.
122	Frozen	Anna		Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?
123	Frozen	Olaf		Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly to where you want it to go.
124	Frozen	Anna		That was like a crazy trust exercise.
125	Frozen	Kristoff		Now that's ice. I'm gonna cry.
126	Frozen	Anna		Go ahead. I won't judge.
127	Frozen	Olaf		Do you think she knows how to knock?
128	Frozen	Anna		Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.
129	Frozen	Kristoff		It's a palace made of ice! Ice is my life!
130	Frozen	Anna		You look ... different! It's a good different.
131	Frozen	Elsa		I never knew what I was capable of.
132	Frozen	Elsa		I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am ... without hurting anybody.
133	Frozen	Olaf		Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!
134	Frozen	Elsa		I'm just trying to protect you!
135	Frozen	Anna		You don't have to protect me, I'm not afraid!
136	Frozen	Elsa		Yes, I'm alone, but I'm alone and free!
137	Frozen	Elsa		Just stay away and you'll be safe from me!
138	Frozen	Anna		You kind of set off an eternal winter ... everywhere.
139	Frozen	Anna		That's okay, you can just unfreeze it!
140	Frozen	Elsa		No escape from the storm inside of me!
141	Frozen	Anna		Don't panic. We'll make the sun shine bright!
142	Frozen	Elsa		What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop /me/?
143	Frozen	Marshmallow		Go away.
144	Frozen	Olaf		Watch out for my butt!
145	Frozen	Anna		It is not nice to throw people!
146	Frozen	Kristoff		Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants. Okay, relax. Just calm down, calm down! Just let the snowman be!
147	Frozen	Olaf		This just got a whole lot harder.
148	Frozen	Kristoff		It'll be like landing on a pillow. Hopefully.
149	Frozen	Anna		Okay, you tell me when. I'm ready to go. I was born ready!
150	Frozen	Olaf		Hey! We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things.
151	Frozen	Olaf		This is not making much of a difference is it?
152	Frozen	Anna		Hey, you were right! Just like a pillow.
153	Frozen	Olaf		I can't feel my legs. I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS!
154	Frozen	Olaf		Do me a favour: grab my butt!
155	Frozen	Kristoff		It's fine. I'm good. I've got a thick skull.
156	Frozen	Olaf		I don't have a skull. Or bones.
157	Frozen	Kristoff		Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business ... worry about your hair!
158	Frozen	Anna		I just fell off a cliff, you should see /your/ hair!
159	Frozen	Olaf		You hesitated.
160	Frozen	Elsa		Get it together. Control it.
161	Frozen	Anna		They're ... rocks.
162	Frozen	Olaf		He's craaaaaaaaazy.
163	Frozen	Random troll #26		She's like a little cupcake!
164	Frozen	Bulda		What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back from such a man?
165	Frozen	Kristoff		Pull us out, Sven.
166	Frozen	Olaf		Let's go kiss Hans! ... who is this Hans?
167	Frozen	Hans		Don't be the monster they fear you are.
168	Frozen	Elsa		Don't you see? I can't.
169	Frozen	Hans		If only there was someone out there who loved you.
170	Frozen	Anna		You're no match for Elsa.
171	Frozen	Hans		Oh ... I already have.
172	Frozen	Olaf		Whoa. So this is heat. I love it ... ooh! But don't touch it!
173	Frozen	Anna		I don't even know what love is.
174	Frozen	Olaf		Love is ... putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here and left you forever.
175	Frozen	Olaf		Some people are worth melting for.
176	Frozen	Olaf		I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.
177	Frozen	Olaf		There's your act of true love right there! Riding across the fjord like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!
178	Frozen	Elsa		Love will thaw ... of course!
179	Frozen	Anna		The only frozen heart around here is yours.
180	Frozen	Duke of Weselton		I am a victim of fear! I have been traumatized—ah! My neck hurts! Is there a doctor I could see? ... no?
181	Frozen	Duke of Weselton		Weselton! It's Weselton!
182	Frozen	Anna		You have to! No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders.
183	Frozen	Anna		I got it, I got it—! I don't got it, I don't got it!
184	Frozen	Olaf		Glide and pivot, and glide and pivot!
