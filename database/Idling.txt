{C minor, put it in C minor . . . }Where have all the good men gone, and where are all the gods?	curls up into a ball of <sadness|loneliness>{ and <despair|grief>} and <cries itself to sleep|starts counting sheep{men}|rocks back and forth>.
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need.	
I need a hero! I'm holding out for a hero 'til the <end of the night|mornin' light>.	
Up where the mountains meet the heavens above -- up where the lightning splits the sea -- I could swear there was someone somewhere watching me.	
I will ride. I will fly. Chase the wind and touch the sky.	
Every morning just the same since the moment that we came to this poor provincial town.	
For, like, the first time ever, I'm completely free.	
Look at the world so close, and I'm halfway to it. Look at it all, so big, do I even dare?	
Look at me, there at last. I just have to do it. Should I?{ No. Here I go.}	
Just smell the grass, the dirt, just like I'd dreamed they'd be.	
Just feel that summer breeze, the way it's calling me.	
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms, just watching the hours tick by.	
*tick* *tock* *tick* *tock* *tick* *tock* *tick* *tock*	
I think some company is overdue; I've started talking to the pictures on the walls.	
For years, I've roamed these empty halls -- why have a ball room with no balls?	
There'll be <actual, real-life|happy, smiling> people; it'll be totally strange. Wow, am I so ready for this change!	
{Peek-a-}boo.	
Let it go -- let it go! <Can't hold it back anymore.|I'm one with the wind and sky!|You'll never see me cry!>	
It's time to see what I can do, to test the limits and break through.	
Yes, I'm alone, but I'm alone and free!{ Just stay away and you'll be safe from me.}	
I never see you anymore -- come out the door -- it's like you've gone away.	
Please, I know you're in there. People are asking where you've been.	
So I'm just the second-born sister, who most of the town ignores, like a button -- like a horseshoe -- like a girl who's bad at metaphors!	
I mean, it's crazy -- we finish each other's . . . <hello|is anybody even here|guys|anyone>? . . . ok.	
Somewhere after midnight, in my wildest fantasy, somewhere just beyond my reach is someone reaching back for me.	
Little town -- it's a quiet village -- every day like the one before. Little town, full of little people waking up to say . . .	
Rich people, old people, all got dreams. Dreams do come true in New Orleans.	
I'm almost there -- I'm almost there. People down here think I'm crazy, but I don't care.	
{Shake my hand. }Come on, boys. Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?	
And so I'll read a book -- or maybe two, or three. I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery.	
I'll play guitar, and knit, and cook, and basically just wonder: when will my life begin?	
And I'll re-read the books if I have time to spare. I'll paint the wall some more -- I'm sure there's room somewhere!	
And then I'll brush and brush, and brush, and brush my hair, stuck in the same place I've always been.	
And I'll keep wondering, and wondering, and wondering, and wondering: when will my life begin?	
I could go running, and racing, and dancing, and chasing, and leaping, and bounding, hair flying, heart pounding, and splashing, and reeling, and finally feeling that's when my life begins!	
I've got a dream, I've got a dream: I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam, and with every passing hour, I'm so glad I left my tower!{ Like all you lovely folks, I've got a dream.}	
Here I stand<, and here I stay -- let the storm rage on.| in the light of day -- let the storm rage on!>	
{Snow glows white on the mountain tonight -- not a footprint to be seen. }A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the queen.	
{As someone told me lately, everyone deserves a chance to fly! And }if I'm flying solo, at least I'm flying free!	
Something has changed within me. Something is not the same.{ I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game.}	
{Too late for second guessing; too late to go back to sleep. }It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes . . . and leap!	
It's time to try defying gravity; I think I'll try defying gravity, and you can't pull me down.	
Too long I've been afraid of losing love I guess I've lost -- well, if that's love, it comes at much too high a cost!	
I may lack style and I may lack grace, and once in a while, I might fall on my face, but this little bot deserves a place in the sky -- this bot wants to fly!	
Please don't shut me out again -- please don't slam the door -- you don't have to keep your distance anymore!	
For the first time in forever, nothing's in my way!	
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.	
{Unlimited. }My future is unlimited.	
I've just had a vision almost like a prophecy. I know -- it sounds truly crazy.	
This gift -- or this curse -- I have inside, maybe, at last, I'll know why.	
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass.	
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse the curtain'd sleep.
